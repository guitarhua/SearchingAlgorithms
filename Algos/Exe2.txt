Sunday at least 2 times faster then brute force
Table= "ABABCFGABABABABAC"
pattern = "ABAB"
The reason why it's 2 times faster is that sunday skipks size of pattern.

Sunday at least 2 times fatser then KMP
Table = "ABABCFGABABABABAC"
pattern = "ABAB"
The same reason why it's 2 times faster: it skips size of pattern.

KMP at least 2 times faster then Rabin - Karp
It happens when we have a lot of same latters so that suffix and prefixes are the same, so we know that they will match anyway.
Table = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA";
pattern = "AA";

Rabin-Karp at least 2 times faster then Sunday
The only idea that how to ruin Sunday algorithm a bit, is to force it to check all the characters of pattern in the text
Table = "ETQEQHFAJFSJAFBZVNCNMZXCNAFJAFMASDMFJASJASFKASFjadjsadASFDKJASSFKASFNsfamaSKFAKFSASDJFAJASFJFGKASDKFNFANFJASDASFASSFSADASDAGDSCZKXVADGANJFWQIUFAJSKFNKA"
pattern = "qwertyuiop[]asdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM"
